"""
Backfill the Continuous Learning streak badges from each learner's historical activity.

OPTIONAL. The live feature starts every learner's streak fresh from the day it is
enabled. Run this command to also credit the streaks learners already had: it derives
each learner's active days (distinct UTC days on which they earned points from a
non-passive action) straight from the Event table, works out which "{N} day streak" and
"{N} weekday streak" milestones those days reached, and grants each such badge once,
dated the day the milestone was first reached. It does **not** replay events.

What it touches, per granted badge (see users.continuous_learning.grant_streak_badge):
the learner's Achievement for that badge (completed in place if the live engine already
keeps an in-progress ring for it), the badge's completion points (Badge.points, paid once
by the normal completion path) and the internal "achievement obtained" event.

What it leaves alone: the streak counters (current_streak / current_weekday_streak and
their last-active dates) and the daily +5 Continuous Learning points. The live engine
keeps tracking today's streaks exactly as before.

Safety and scale:
  * Dry-run by default: read-only, prints what would be granted. ``--commit`` to apply.
  * Idempotent: a badge the learner already holds (live or from an earlier run) is
    skipped, so re-running, or running over learners the live feature has credited, is safe.
  * ``--shard k/N`` restricts the run to learners with ``GammaUser.id % N == k``, so N
    processes can run side by side over disjoint learners. Each grant takes the learner's
    row lock, so shards and live events never interleave on the same learner.
  * Work is organised per learner, not per event: one grouped query per batch of
    learners returns their (learner, day) pairs, so cost scales with learners and
    active days rather than with the (much larger) number of events.
  * Grants are silent (no "badge earned" toast) unless ``--notify`` is passed.
