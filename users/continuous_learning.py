"""
Continuous Learning — daily activity points and streak badges.

A learner has an "active day" whenever they are logged in and perform an action that
earns them points (submitting an answer, completing a unit, posting in the forum, …).
Because earning points requires an authenticated session, "earned points today" already
implies "logged in today", so an active day is detected simply by a point-earning event
arriving for the user (see ``rules.signals.process_event_creation``).

For every active day the learner is awarded :data:`DAILY_ACTIVE_POINTS` into a single
"Continuous Learning" bucket on their Points Distribution. The daily points have no
EventConfiguration (one config carries a single fixed award, but the bucket needs to
accept the plain daily amount), so they are written straight to the user's
totals/chart/progress via GammaUser helpers.

Active days also build *streaks*, of which there are two kinds (:data:`STREAK_KINDS`),
counted side by side from that same activity:

* **daily** — consecutive calendar days; badge "{N} day streak".
* **weekday** — consecutive weekdays (Mon–Fri); badge "{N} weekday streak". Saturdays and
  Sundays are invisible to this kind: weekend activity neither extends a run nor breaks
  one, so a learner who only studies on workdays carries a live streak across the
  weekend. Without it such a learner resets to 1 every Monday and can never pass 5,
  putting the 10/20/30 day-streak badges permanently out of reach.

The "{N} … streak" badges are ordinary rule-driven badges (one rule each, action
``{<the kind's event>: {count: N}}``) awarded by the rules engine — exactly like the
points-threshold badges. After a counter advances we emit that kind's internal event so
its rules re-evaluate against the counter: the dashboard then shows an in-progress ring
(streak / N) and the badge completes — paying its bonus points to the user's total and
points timeline via the normal completion path — when the streak reaches N.

All work runs under the per-user row lock already held by the event signal, so the
read-modify-write of the streak counters and points is safe against concurrent events.
